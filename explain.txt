Web Search Engines (Project 1)

Execution:

1. When the user runs the file web-crawler.py the program asks the user for a search query for focused crawling.

2. The program then creates an Instance of the class WebCrawler with this query. The creation of the Instance leads to the calling of the method WebCrawler.fetch_google_results().

3. The google results are then stored in a priority queue along with their depth and Okapi BM25 score.

4. The Program then calls the method WebCrawler.crawl(). This method retrieves the url with the highest BM25 score from the Priority Queue and then parses it by calling WebCrawler.parse_page() method alongside adding the URL to visited list.

5. The parse page method extracts all the links from the given webpage, calculates the BM25 score for the page and inserts the page into the URLs priority queue.

6. Once all links have been parsed we jump back to step 4.

7. After the required no. of links have been crawled, the output is written to a file "output.txt"
